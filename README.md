# Chess-Challenges

These projects are my first coding experience at university, focuses on Object-oriented Programming usnig Java language. The objective was to learn OOP model to organize software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

## Overview

### Project 1: Check the moves

In this project, the current state of a chess game are given by the user.We want to see what moves can be done in the current state.

#### How does it work?

The first line of the input contains the number ùëõ , which is the total number of pieces on the chess board. 

ùëõ next line each specifies the type and location of the pieces. Each of these ùëõ lines contains a 4-character string: 

- The first character specifies the color of the piece, which can be one of two characters: W, which means white, or B, which means black.

- The second character specifies the type of piece (like R for Rook and K for Knight)

- The third and fourth characters specify the location of the piece.

After the pieces are specified, the next line contains ùëö, which means the number of questions, and the questions are located in ùëö of the next line.

Each question contains a 4-character string:
- the first two characters of which indicate the initial location of the moving pieces

- the second two characters of the desired location for the movement of the pieces.

#### The output

The output should contain ùëö lines, each line containing the answer to a question.

The answer to each question is one of the three words **YES**, which means that it is possible to move, **NO**, which means that the move is not correct, and **TAKE**, which means that with this move, a piece from the opposite side is taken.

#### Example

- **Input :**
   ```sh
   4
   WRE4
   BQE7
   WPE2
   BPD3
   5
   E2E3
   E2E4
   E4E7
   E4E1
   D3E2

- **Output :**
   ```sh
   YES
   NO
   TAKE
   NO
   TAKE
### Project 2: Count the possible moves

In this project, the current state of a chess game are given by the user.We want to count the number of possible moves of a particular piece.

#### How does it work?

The mechanism of this project is the same as the previous one, with the difference that each question contains a character string of length 2 that specifies the location of the desired piece to count the number of moves.

#### Example

- **Input :**
   ```sh
   4
   WRE4
   BQE7
   WPE2
   BPD3
   3
   E2
   E4
   D3
![example image](images/example.png)

- **Output :**
   ```sh
   2
   11
   2
